# commented this because we created ansible-value file credentails.yaml file to use vars-files
# also while running the command need to provide the vault auth password in the command

#1 if we run the command without providing vault authorization..
# [ ec2-user@ip-172-31-17-141 ~/expense-ansible-roles ]$ ansible-playbook db.yaml
# ERROR! Attempting to decrypt but no vault secrets found

#2 run the command by providing vault authorization..
# [ ec2-user@ip-172-31-17-141 ~/expense-ansible-roles ]$ ansible-playbook db.yaml --ask-vault-pass
# Vault password:
# and it will continue to run the other commands
